Often, the different dice required to activate each blessing are represented by variables “x” or “y” which represent any dice values to fulfill their requirements (ex. “xxyy” can be “2244” or “5533” or any other number of combinations, provided there are 2 “x” values and 2 “y” values).

<br>
Reinforce: the game mechanic in which a player may add another unit of the exact type and numbers to an existing one to increase the total number of models and point cost (ex. 10 guard reinforced to 20 total). Each unit may only be reinforced once.
