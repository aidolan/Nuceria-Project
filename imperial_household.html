Army Rule <br>
Any number of “Custodes” models (including “Leaders”) may detach and join units freely as part of their movement, provided all models in the combined unit are the same type and they start/end within unit coherency. For this reason, there is no upper or lower limit on number of models in a unit. When splitting, this creates two separate units with different activations, even if they were a single unit in prior activations. Conversely, combining with other units creates a single activation. In addition, the following apply:<br>
•	Guardians of the Golden Throne: For each of the three action slots available, units in this army may choose any (Fight, Move, Activate Abilities) to use even if that action has been used already in their same activation. <br>
•	The Emperor’s Auspice: each time a “Custodes” unit makes an attack, choose “Sustained 1” or “+1 to hit”.<br>
•	Counterspell and Silence: each time an enemy unit makes a “psychic” attack or ability within 12” of a “Sisters of Silence” unit, roll 1d6. On a 2+, that attack is “silenced” and does not occur.<br>
