<br><br>

Army Rule <br>
Swiftness of the Stars: When a unit activates and takes the “Move” action, 1x friendly “Aeldari” unit within 12” may take the “Move” action also. <br>
Last of Their Kind: Units below ½ strength may take 1x extra action when no other friendly units are within 12”. <br>
<br><br>

Select one Military Tradition from below:<br>
Whispers of Ynnari<br>
Each time an “Aeldari” unit is destroyed, select one friendly “Ynnari” unit and restore it to full strength (including returning any destroyed models). This ability cannot target destroyed units.<br>
<br><br>

Pain of Drukhari<br>
Attacks against enemy units generate a “Pain Token” which is attached to the target and represents mortal wounds. Pain tokens can be activated at any time by the Drukhari player to deal damage according to the table below (Fibonacci Sequence). Pain tokens can only be cleansed by spending that unit’s activation to “Cleanse” themselves and cannot use any other actions or abilities while doing so.<br> 
Pain Tokens	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10<br>
Damage	1	2	3	5	8	13	21	34	55	89<br>

Madness of the Harlequinns<br>
Carnival of Fate: At the start of the game, roll 10d6 and set aside as your “Fate Dice” for the battle. These dice may be used once per activation at any time to replace any of your own rolls. After the final dice is expended, roll another 10d6 and refill your “Fate Dice” pool. Continue until game conclusion. <br>
<br><br>

Primordial Exodites<br>
Primal Rage: Friendly units generate "Rage" for each turn that it is in combat with the same enemy unit. Begin at 0 when first enters combat and increase by 1 (to max of 3) for each subsequent activation. For each "Rage" Counter, +1 damage to this unit's weapons. When this unit leaves combat, reduce "Rage" by one for each activation taken outside of melee combat.<br>
