<br><br>

Setup<br>
1.	Determine number of players and size of armies (50 or 100 points is standard)<br>
2.	Determine military traditions and mission rules (basic or extended).<br>
3.	Select battlefield of any size (48”x60” is recommended)<br>
4.	Mark two deployment zones 12” away from one table edge (length or width both ok)<br>
5.	Determine which player has first turn. That player leads the following steps.<br>
6.	Players alternate to place 3-6 objectives, with one in each deployment zone<br>
7.	Players alternate to place 6-8 pieces of terrain <br>
8.	Players alternate to place 2-4 pieces of walls/craters/woods (optional)<br>
9.	Select warlord (must remain on board until destroyed).  <br>
10.	Players alternate to place units from their army within their deployment zone or reserves. <br>
<br><br>

Scoring<br>
Players need 10 points to win. Objectives can be anything but typically a 8” round mousepad to represent area of control is best.<br>
	Killing warlord worth 5<br>
	Establish Perimeter (non-battleshocked units within 12” of all table corners) worth 5<br>
	Each objective worth 2<br>
	Capture enemy outpost worth +1 <br>
	Bring it down (killing “colossal” units) worth 1 per unit<br>
	(optional rules) Cleanse (terrain) worth 1 (place d6 tags on battlefield)<br>
	(optional rules) Recover Assets (objectives) worth 1 place d6 tags on battlefield)<br>

Actions<br>
This is an alternating activation game, meaning that players select one unit at a time to activate and then pass their turn unless a special rule is active. “Token” units may activate with their lead unit but can act and move separately. Players may activate any unit, including the one activated in the previous turn, unless a specific rule states otherwise.
<br>
Certain actions trigger at the beginning of every unit activation, such as Battle Shock. If any rule states that it occurs “At the start of this unit’s activation”, that rule is resolved now. These actions occur before any other actions as they may have consequences on player decisions.
<br>
When a unit activates, they may perform the following actions in any order:<br>
	Use Abilities<br>
	Move<br>
	Attack<br>
<br><br>

Dice<br>
Each time an action calls for a dice check, use a six-sided die (“d6”). Refer to the specific rules of the action you’re performing to determine the value needed for success, but “1” is typically a failure while “6” is typically a success. When in doubt, use common sense and discuss with your opponent to determine the outcome of an action.
<br><br>

Abilities<br>
Unit Abilities come in two forms: “Direct” and “Aura”. Direct Abilities affect only a specific unit, while Aura Abilities affect any number of units within their given range. Direct Abilities are typically active and must be used during a unit’s activation, while Aura Abilities are typically passive and affect the game outside of a unit’s activation. Abilities cannot be used while in a “Transport” or “Reserves”. Refer to the Lexicon for a list of basic Unit Abilities.
<br>
Some units may have multiple abilities. In this case, all abilities are active simultaneously, unless stated otherwise or affected by other rules. If two abilities are active for the same unit and grant the same bonus (“Sustained Hits 1” vs “Sustained Hits 2”), use the higher value. 
<br>
Weapon Abilities determine how some weapons perform beyond their normal stats. This provides players with flexible options and interactive gameplay. Refer to the Lexicon for a list of Weapon Abilities.
<br><br>

Movement<br>
Movement allows a unit to reposition around the battlefield. When doing so, use the “Movement” stat from that unit’s datasheet to determine how far that unit can move, then measure from a unit’s base or hull. All distances are measured in inches. Using a tape measure is recommended for smooth gameplay, but the game can also be conducted on a 1” grid map. In this case, movement refers to the number of squares that unit can move.
<br>
Units may move and pivot freely as part of this action, so long as all parts of the unit’s base or hull remain behind the farthest point measured earlier. Models must stay within 1” of each other to be in unit coherency. Units outside of this cannot make any actions except “Move”. 
<br>
Units can move into engagement range without having to declare a “Charge” but do not gain the benefit of a “Charge”. Units may move out of melee range freely (unless a rule states otherwise), but doing so triggers an “Attack of Opportunity” where the enemy unit may attack that unit as it falls back. These attacks gain the “Devastating Wounds” weapon ability.
<br>
Whenever you make a “Move” action, choose one for each unit:<br>
	Normal Move<br>
	Charge (Movement Speed + d6)<br>
	Arrive from Reserves<br>
<br>
Normal Move<br>
Move any distance up to the value on a unit’s “Movement” stat.
<br>
Charge<br>
Add 1d6 to a unit’s “Movement” stat and move that unit up to that distance. Units that “Charge” cannot use ranged weapons after making such a move unless they have “Assault”. All melee weapons may be used after charging into melee range.
<br>
Arriving from Reserves<br>
Up to ½ of an army’s total points may be placed in reserves. Any number of these units may arrive on the battlefield during their own activation and must be placed outside of engagement range and within 6” of any table edge (except your opponent’s deployment zone). Units with “Deepstrike” may be placed anywhere on the table (including engagement range). Maybe -1 to hit? 
<br>
Transports<br>
Many units can be placed in transports to traverse the battlefield faster. When embarked, they may activate separately from their transport to disembark within 3” and take actions as normal. Alternatively, the transport can force the unit inside to disembark within 3” as part of its “Movement” action, but in this case the unit inside gets no activation.
<br><br>

Attack<br>
When a unit chooses to make attacks, you must choose whether it will be a “Ranged Attack” or “Melee Attack”. After doing so, that unit may use every weapon of that type it is equipped with if it is eligible to do so. If any unit is eligible to make ranged/melee attacks, all models in the unit are eligible to make attacks unless their weapon range is different. In this case, measure from that model.
<br>
The controlling player must make an “Attack Roll” and cast a number of dice equal to the total number of attacks for the weapons they are using, comparing the attack’s “Power” against the target’s “Toughness”. For each success, one “Hit” is scored.
<br>
A reference table for power comparison and the dice value needed for an attack to succeed is provided below:
<br>
Power Comparison/Effects	Dice Value Needed<br>
Always Failure	1<br>
Power is 2x the value of Toughness	2+<br>
Power is greater than Toughness	3+<br>
Power is equal to Toughness 	4+<br>
Power is lower than Toughness	5+<br>
Toughness is 2x the value of Power 	6+<br>
Always Success	6+<br>
<br><br>

Making Saves<br>
For each hit scored, the defending player must roll one die to score their unit’s save value or higher. To determine if a saving roll is successful or not, use the following format:
<br>
Save Value + Attacking Weapon’s AP Value = Dice Value Needed
<br>
Any dice value that cannot be rolled on a normal d6 (7+) automatically fails. A unit’s save characteristic cannot be lowered below a 2+ save through any means (such as “Cover”), and dice rolls of 1 always fail. Units with “Invulnerable Save” values ignore any result needed for success above a certain number and always succeed on their “Invulnerable Save” value instead. Some powerful units may also have access to “Legendary Saves”, allowing them to automatically pass a few rolls per/game after failing. 
<br>
Shooting
<br>
Ranged attacks can be made against targets at distance and are determined by the individual stats of each weapon. Targets must be within the unit’s “Line of Sight” which is determined from the model’s base (if “Infantry”) or hull/torso (if “Vehicle” or “Monster”). Wings, arms, weapons, and other tendrils should be treated as being in motion and are not valid points to measure “Line of Sight” from.
<br>
All units can shoot into units in melee range (or out of it) at -1 to hit provided their weapons do not have “Blast” Weapon Ability. Infantry in melee range must use “Pistol” weapons to shoot into or out of combat but do not suffer -1 to hit. Vehicles and Monsters do not have this restriction but maintain -1 to hit if locked in combat.
<br>
All ranged weapons also have a “Cooldown” Weapon Ability based on their power stat. This represents how many of the controlling player’s turns need to pass before it can shoot again and is designed to represent the long-range power of such weapons and the difficulty of firing them. While specific values are on unit sheets, a general grouping is below:
<br>
	Battleline – 0<br>
	Heavy Weapon Systems – 1<br>
	Tank Primary Armaments – 2<br>
	Super Heavy Weapons Systems – 3<br>
<br>

Melee<br>
Melee attacks can be made against targets in “Melee Range” and are determined by the individual stats of each weapon. Melee range is determined as being within 1” of a unit’s base/hull/torso and does not include wings, arms, weapons, and other tendrils unless they are an “Aircraft”. At least one model from a unit must be within melee range of an enemy unit to attack, but all models in that unit may fight if so engaged. Units in melee range are “Locked in Combat” and cannot make another “Move” action without triggering an Attack of Opportunity.
<br>
Any movement into melee range with a terrain piece that contains an opposing unit is considered melee range for the unit, regardless of distance. Units with at least one model outside of the terrain piece can fight in at -1 to hit. 
<br>
If a unit activates an “Attack” action first and destroys the unit locking it in melee, the activating unit may continue to perform actions such as “Move” etc. if it has not done so already. 
<br><br>

Spellcasting<br>
Some armies have access to magical actions or abilities. These types can be divided into “Passive Magic” and “Active Magic”. All magic can be disrupted by counterspell or battleshock, and units that are affected by these effects are not eligible to cast spells, whether passive or active.
<br>
Passive Magic is when a magical ability does not take an action to use but is always present. Passive magic is usually weaker and does not require a cost to use.
<br>
Active Magic is a type of magic that requires an action to use and replaces the “Attack” option for that unit. Active magic is typically strong and has a cost to use.
<br><br>

Terrain<br>
Terrain is a wide and versatile resource for battlefields that may include ruins, buildings, shipwrecks, rocks, forests, craters, and more. To maintain simplicity, this game has divided them into two distinct types: “Obscuring Terrain” and “Environmental Terrain”. All terrain pieces, regardless of type, are exactly as they look and do not go “infinitely up” or have invisible walls. This means that units that are physically larger than terrain (excluding wings, arms, weapons, and tendrils) but still obscured can be targeted with the benefit of “Cover”. 
<br><br>

Obscuring Terrain includes all objects that interrupt “Line of Sight”, including ruins, walls, containers, mountains, and more. Units may shoot into units hiding in this type of terrain if it has a footprint (such as ruins). These objects provide cover and units gain certain benefits determined by the amount they receive:
<br>
	No Cover: Units with base/model fully exposed have no cover bonus.
<br>
	Half Cover: Bases/models less than ½ obscured have +1 to save
<br>
	Full Cover: Bases/models more than ½ obscured have +2 to save
<br>
	Hidden: Units with bases/models not visible cannot be targeted through normal means.
<br>
Obscuring Terrain also provides tactical benefits for offense. Ranged Attacks from the upper levels of this terrain (+2” height) provide that unit with +1 to hit. Melee Attacks may also be performed against units within 3” vertically, providing that unit +1 to hit.
<br>
Infantry units are the only type of unit that can enter and move through Obscuring Terrain. Some such terrain is impassable though, such as mountains and containers. Use common sense while playing to determine if a unit may move through a piece of terrain or not.
<br>
Environmental Terrain includes objects that do not interrupt “Line of Sight”, such as craters, woods, ice, and lava fields. This terrain provides no cover but halves movement as units pass through it (rounded up). All units may enter and move through Environmental Terrain, and “Fly” units do not suffer the movement penalty for doing so.
