<br><br>

Army Rule <br>
Synapse: Some Tyranids units have “Synapse”. Units within 6” of this model are within Synapse and may take 1x action whenever a unit with the primary “Synapse” keyword activates. Synapse units are automatically within Synapse and may also follow this rule. Additionally, any number of Genestealer Cults units may join a Tyranids army.<br>
Select one Military Tradition from below:
<br><br>

Invasion Fleet<br>
Gain the following:<br>
•	Endless Swarms: Each time a “Swarm” unit is destroyed, roll 1d6. On a 4+, return that unit to reserves.<br>
•	Bio-Horror Transports: After arriving on the battlefield and disembarking the units within, Tyrannocyte units may be returned to reserves and any eligible unit in reserves may embark within it.<br>
•	Shadow in the Warp: Once per game, at any time, you may use this ability. When you do, every enemy unit must make a battleshock test -1 for each “Tyrant” on the battlefield. <br>
<br><br>

Genestealer Cults<br>
Doomsday Heralds: Genestealer Cult units have an Ascension “x” ability, where “x” represents how many friendly activations before they come back to reserves after being destroyed. Units that have returned through “Ascension” are placed into reserves and may return to the battlefield within 6” of an objective under your control. Units with leaders must meet the combined “Ascension” value of both units to return together, but may be returned separately as each value is reached. Additionally, any number of Tyranids units may join a Genestealer Cults army.<br>
Genestealer Cults can steal/use tech from other armies and can mash them together to make unique. These weapons are always -1 to hit but retain all other characteristics.<br>
Children of the Void<br>
At the start of the game, roll 1d6 for each unit you have left in your army (units that are destroyed and have not returned to regular play with “Ascension” do not count) and select a blessing from below. Each time an enemy unit is destroyed, reroll dice with new total and select a new blessing to replace the one currently active for your army:<br>
	(x) Proof of Faith: 6+ FNP<br>
	(xx) Tireless Fervor: +2 to charge rolls.<br>
	(xxx) Alien Bio-Stimm: Sustained Hits 1<br>
	(xxxx) Herald The Masters!: Activate Shadow in the Warp <br>
	(xxxxx) Bio-Horror Revelation: Once per activation, in place of the chosen unit’s normal actions, you may sacrifice any number of Genestealer Cult models within 12” of an objective under your control and remove them permanently from the battlefield (they do not activate their “Ascension” ability). Place a tyranid “Monster” equivalent to the number of health sacrificed directly onto the objective marker. This ends the activation.<br>
	(xxxxxx) The Downtrodden Rise: 3x units may activate at a time.<br>
