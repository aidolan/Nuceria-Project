<br><br>

Army Rule <br>
Followers of the Omnissiah: After deployment, roll 4d6 and select one blessing from below. Every time an “Adeptus Mechanicus” unit activates within 6” of a ruin or terrain piece, roll a dice and add it to your “Archeotech” dice pool. You may add any number of these to a blessings roll. When spent, Archeotech Dice are lost. Every time an enemy unit is destroyed, you may roll 4d6 and choose a new blessing from below to replace the one currently active for your army:<br>
	(x) Servo-Skulls: Objectives remain under your control once taken.<br>
	(xx) Mechanized Offense: “Vehicles” gain +1 to hit.<br>
	(xxx) Propulsion Armor: “Vehicles” may take 1x “Move” action whenever a friendly unit within 12” activates.<br>
	(xxyy) Breath of the Omnisiah: All “Vehicles” gain a shield that blocks 4 damage on their activation. This shield does not count as permanent health, cannot be used to heal your unit, and expires at the beginning of your next activation. If your next activation is the same vehicle unit, it instead refreshes. <br>
	(xxxx) Shock-Resistant Plating: “Vehicles” take ½ damage from all sources.<br>
	Reroll any dice and select a different blessing (This cannot be selected again until new Blessings roll is made). <br>
<br><br>

Select one Military Tradition from below:<br>
Doctrina Imperatives<br>
	Protector Imperative: All AP against “Mechanicum” units is reduced by 1. <br>
	Conquer Imperative: Weapons gain “Assault” keyword.<br>
	Engineer Imperative: “Vehicle” units may heal for d3 wounds every activation.<br>
<br><br>

Rad Bombardment<br>
	Nuclear Fallout: 1 mortal wound to a unit every time it activates (friendly and foe). Vehicles and “Rad” troops are immune. Units on objectives suffer d3 mortal wounds instead.<br>
	“Skitarii” units may take the “Move” action after being attacked.<br>
<br><br>

Dark Mechanicum<br>
Vehicle units may enter a dark pact with the machine spirits and daemons within them, gaining either "Sustained Hits 1" or "Devastating Wounds". That unit must then take a battleshock test, taking d6 damage on failure.<br>
<br><br>

Legio Titanica <br>
Void Shields. “Titan” units have Void Shields which provide 4+ invulnerability to them and all friendly units within 12”. Units with Void Shields “x” gain a number of Legendary Saves equal to “x” (ex. a Reaver Titan has Void Shields 6 and gains 6x Legendary Saves). Additionally, any number of “Voidsmen” units may join a Legio Titanicus army.<br>
Exemplars of Might: Each time a “Colossal” unit activates, 3x units without the “Colossal” keyword within 12” may take 1x action. <br>
<br>
God Engines of War<br>
Titan Shock: At the end of a “Titan” unit’s activation, all enemy units within 24” of that unit must make a battleshock test at -2. If failed, they are “Titan Shocked” and cannot activate during your opponent’s next turn. <br>
