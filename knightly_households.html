<br><br>

Army Rule <br>
Ion Shields: “Knight” units gain an Ion Shield which provides additional protection to themselves and those behind it. This shield takes the form of a 6” line and only protects against attacks coming from one direction. The Ion Shield can be repositioned freely in the controlling unit’s activation phase, and must be set up within 3” of the unit. Ion Shields provide the controlling unit a 4+ invulnerable save and “Half Cover” to all other units behind it. <br>
Exemplars of Might: Each time a “Colossal” unit activates, 2x units without the “Colossal” keyword within 12” may take 1x action. <br>
