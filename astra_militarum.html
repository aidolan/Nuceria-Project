<br><br>

Army Rule <br>
Officers can assign a number of orders during their activation based on their “Order: x” Unit Ability. No limit on infantry/vehicle types – any officer unit can give out orders to any other unit that has not activated during that activation. Orders allow officers to select one action of another unit to trigger:<br>
	Attack<br>
	Move<br>
	Use Ability<br>
<br><br>

Select one Military Tradition from below:<br>
Cadia<br>
Born Soldiers: Critical hits are scored on 5+.<br>
<br><br>

Krieg<br>
Litany of Sacrifice: Every time a friendly unit dies, 1x “Krieg” unit may activate. <br>
<br><br>

Scions of Empire<br>
Elite Commandos: “Aquilons”, “Scions”, and “Kasrkin” models gain +1 health and a 4+ invulnerable save. <br>
<br><br>

Mordian Guard<br>
Officers can also give out buffs with their orders. These buffs remain until the unit is chosen to activate again, either through normal means or by receiving new orders:<br>
	Over the Top! – add 2” to movement.<br>
	Bayonets! - +2 Power in melee<br>
	Take Aim! - +2 Power in ranged<br>
	Ranked Fire! - +1A for ranged weapons<br>
	Take Cover! - +1 to save <br>
	Stand and Die! – add 1 to OC and Leadership Values<br>

Units may activate after disembarking from a transport during its activation. This rule supersedes any other rule that gives extra “Actions” or “Activations” upon disembarking from a transport.
