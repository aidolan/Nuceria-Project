Factions
<br><br>
All armies have unique traits and abilities that help them wage war against other factions within 40k. Within these army rules, factions also have access to various “Military Traditions” which allow more varied, strategic, and thematic gameplay. Only one Army Rule and Military tradition may be active for your army at one time (unless stated otherwise) and must be declared at the beginning of the game, before deployment begins.
The various factions and their Army Rules and Military Traditions are explored below:
