Army Rule <br>
Philosophy of Collaboration: During a unit’s activation, they may use this ability to “Spot” a target that is within Line of Sight to themselves. Next, select one friendly unit to collaborate with. That unit may activate during this unit’s activation but may only “Attack” the spotted target. Units in “Deep Strike” or “Reserves” are eligible to be “Guided” units. Units that are battleshocked cannot spot or be spotted for.

Select one Military Tradition from below.<br>
Puretide’s Teachings<br>
Gain the following:<br>
	Kauyon: A unit may choose to follow Kauyon instead of making a normal “Attack” action. In this case, the unit holds its attacks and instead selects an enemy unit to patiently wait for. When that target ends its movement or activation within Line of Sight and range of one or more of the Kauyon unit’s weapons, the Kauyon unit immediately makes an attack and its weapons gain “Sustained Hits 2”. If the Kauyon unit takes any actions before its target comes into range, Kauyon is lost and must be re-established. Any number of units may declare a Kauyon target in their activation and may choose any target (including those already marked by another). Units may also move their Kauyon target by activating and selecting a new target to wait patiently for. <br>
	Mont’ka: A unit may choose to follow Mont’ka instead of making a normal “Attack” action. In this case, the unit deals double damage but allows the opponent to trigger two activations in their next turn.<br>
	Monat: A unit may choose to follow Monat instead of making a normal “Attack” action. If no friendly units are within 12” of this unit and it is not “Guided”, gain +1 to hit and +1AP. Only one unit in your army may declare “Monat” at a time and must continue to follow this doctrine until destroyed.<br>
